        <description>Home Internet There&amp;rsquo;re wireled and wireless Internet devices for home Internet users, wireled device connects to the Internet via Ethernet and wireless device connects via WiFi. Current WiFi is IEEE802.11ac standard, it has dual band, 5GHz band and 2.4GHz band.
ß
Normally wireless connection is more stable and faster, while maintianing stable and fast connection for wireless is a challenge.
Testing scenario Home user&amp;rsquo;s Internet normally consist: Optical Network Router (ONR), it will translate optical signal to network as modem, and since the name &amp;lsquo;router&amp;rsquo;, it is also a DHCP server.</description>

        <description>What&amp;rsquo;s mesh? Mesh overview  IEEE published the 802.11 amendment for mesh networking, 802.11s, primary goal is targeted to provide more stable better performance for the whole network using more &amp;lsquo;connected nodes&amp;rsquo;. The entire wireless mesh could be treated as a single (giant) Ethernet switch.     Mesh advantages: simple, fast installation, more suitable for the application:  Where wires are not desired (e.g., hotels, airports) Where wires are impossible (e.</description>

        <description>Background  Rsnapshot is a rsync based utility, as the name suggests, it can take the snapshot of the filesystem at the moment, the backup disk size is made up only with the size of filesystem and the differences between different snapshots.
The OS I was using is Linux CentOS then, simliar steps should be followed across different OS.
Follow the steps below to get the utility running and monitor the file generate after the set scheduled time.</description>

        <description>When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$</description>

        <description>The following
$$ \int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx $$
Is an integral
$$ \varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } } $$
Enable Katex in the config file by setting the katex param to true. This will import the necessary Katex CSS/JS.
See the online reference of supported TeX functions.
Note: For inline math to render correctly, your content file extension must be .mmark. See the official mmark site.
Inline math: $ \varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.</description>

        <description>Hello and welcome! This website is a blog, also serves as a Curriculum vitae. Lifelong learning is something I am passionate about, I always have the belief of more possibilities opened up when I learn more and everything is useful eventually in some way, I try to encourage myself to learn in a more organised manner and have a place to share some of the findings, so I will also share some basic understanding related but not limited to software, IT, finance, etc.</description>
