Realized the student\u0026rsquo;s basic theory is weak, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand how fraction works and how to apply the formula.  Procedure  Researched about how to carry online session. Looked for softcopy of materials, found it in the WhatsAPP group and shared before session. Reviewd the homework. Went through how to do fraction transformation.  Carried some fraction caculation on plus and minus.    Session Training session of this week4 and week5 lasts two hours from 8pm - 10pm on Fridays.\nReviewed the student about decimal number, went through fraction related knowledges.\nFeedback During the session, since it is online format, some conmmunication is not as smooth, and the working steps are difficult to discuss or show to student, student was distracted by playing with the APP and his laptop.\n Some methods to address the obstacles were asking student to repeat what I said, and read out loud on some formula or theories.\n During the session, I learnt something as well:\n Online session is more difficult than face-to-face because the student is easily distracted.

Practice on the weakness of the pupils.  Background  After the first week\u0026rsquo;s session, get to know the kid and understand he is very weak in Math and the time left for preparing exam is only five months. Realized the student\u0026rsquo;s calculation ability is weak, he is still counting fingers when encounter any calculation. Student is shy but willing to learn and listen to instructions which is good.  Procedure  Reviewed the circle formula with him but he had fogotten the formula The student also didn\u0026rsquo;t finish the homework. Review circle. Gave him the easy way to memorize the formula as C=2 pie R, and S=pie R2. And asked him to write down the same formula for all the related questions during test. Review previous topics like number, algebra.  Session Training session of this week 2 and week 3 is two hours from 8pm - 10pm on this Friday 30th April 2021 and 6th May 2021 respectively.\nReview the student on his weakness of circles, work on algebra and negtive value and fraction.\nFeedback During the session, student can pick up easy questions, but still bad in calculation, made mistakes sometimes. Taught him some tricks:\n During MCQ questions, assume 1 number and think if it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable for the choice if doens\u0026rsquo;t know how to solve,\ni.e. Mike is x years old, his mother\u0026rsquo;s age is triple Mikes', what is Mike\u0026rsquo;s mother\u0026rsquo;s age?\nChoice: 1) x+3; 2) x/3; 3) x-3; 4) 3x\nIf don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer, let\u0026rsquo;s assume Mike\u0026rsquo;s x =10, so for all the first 3 choice will be the age of 13, 3.333; 7; all don\u0026rsquo;t make sense, the fouth choice is 30, possible, so it\u0026rsquo;s the only choice.\n During the session, I learnt something as well:\n The parent is willing to put more effort on the student, they hired another turor, but the other class is not 1-to-1 so didn\u0026rsquo;t go through everything the student done. The parent offers to hire me for more turoring sessions, but unfortunately I don\u0026rsquo;t have too much extra time and it is not right to charge since I work on volunteer purpose. The student actively asked for homework, and this time I only gave him two questions so he has more time and more willingness to finish them rather than avoid them. It\u0026rsquo;s a good sign he wants to put more effort.  To-Do\u0026rsquo;s  Check-in weekly status to the organization Review previous topic on fraction and number and calculation.

And finish this week\u0026rsquo;s learning goal. And plan next sessions.\nBackground Preparation: The work I have done is to go through the coach briefing and review the PLSE syllabus. Get an idea of how much time do I get to prepare the student to pass the exam and how to organize the training sessions including timing and venue.\nAbout the student: Primary six student, grade is AL8 which represent \u0026lt; 20 out of 100\nProcedure  Introduce oneself to both of the parents and the student Set up goal for the whole program\nIncrease the mark from AL8 to AL5, for \u0026lt;20 to 65~74, originally the student proposed of 45~64\nThe logic behind is to get 6 marks increment per month for the remaining 5 months\nTarget for the student is to get to his dream school which he already had in mind Start collecting the student\u0026rsquo;s studuy materials\nSchool textbook, school workbook as the main source, other supplementary material depends on the progress to be used as add-ons  Session Training session last duration of this time is two hours from 8pm - 10pm on this Friday 23 April 2021.\nTaught the student on his weakness of circles, during the session, realized he has also weakness in calculation, but since exam allows to bring calculator, so didn\u0026rsquo;t work on that part much.\nInstead of teaching on each question, taught him the methodology:\n Write the general formula -\u0026gt; Formula shifpform to the given condition -\u0026gt; substitue in all the numbers -\u0026gt; calculate\n Like in the circle circumference questions, taught the student to write same formula for all the questions, and then look intot the given conditions and shift the formula\n  C = Pi * d Change d to 2r if the only given r Input all the number Calculate   He can apply the method to all the questions eventually, then when doing circle area questions, he knows how to apply same method with different fomula.\nFeedback Asked the student to practice, and plan to give two questions regarding circle cicumeference and area in the next session.\nDuring the session, I learnt something as well:\n Be more patient, especially with kid, they are shy and fragile, more sensitive to your experession and tone. Bonding is important. Understand how the others' mind work, and think what\u0026rsquo;s a better way to tech them to accept Encouragment is important so they not feel too frustrated. Learnt some Math terms in English since my elementary Math was taught in Chinese, some terms I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar or never heard of. Also reviewed some forgoten knowledge like what\u0026rsquo;s chord.  To-Do\u0026rsquo;s  Check-in weekly status to the organization Share the signed goal-setting document signed by the student with the parents Printout practice questions regarding circle for next session work on composite circle next week Review previous primary five questions since the review time left for the student is only one month at most after he finish his whole textbook.
