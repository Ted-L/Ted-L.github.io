[{"content":"SG care volunteer program This is a volunteer programm for Primary School Leaving Examinatio (PSLE) Maths Coaching Initiative.\n Target audience  Student with D and E grades For families with per capita inciome of S$450 and below   Objective  To achieve at least an AL6 for the students' MATH exam    This week\u0026rsquo;s objectives It is the first week of this program, the expectation of myself is to get to know the student; set up a goal for the kid. And finish this week\u0026rsquo;s learning goal. And plan next sessions.\nBackground Preparation: The work I have done is to go through the coach briefing and review the PLSE syllabus. Get an idea of how much time do I get to prepare the student to pass the exam and how to organize the training sessions including timing and venue.\nAbout the student: Primary six student, grade is AL8 which represent \u0026lt; 20 out of 100\nProcedure  Introduce oneself to both of the parents and the student Set up goal for the whole program\nIncrease the mark from AL8 to AL5, for \u0026lt;20 to 65~74, originally the student proposed of 45~64\nThe logic behind is to get 6 marks increment per month for the remaining 5 months\nTarget for the student is to get to his dream school which he already had in mind Start collecting the student\u0026rsquo;s studuy materials\nSchool textbook, school workbook as the main source, other supplementary material depends on the progress to be used as add-ons  Session Training session last duration of this time is two hours from 8pm - 10pm on this Friday 23 April 2021.\nTaught the student on his weakness of circles, during the session, realized he has also weakness in calculation, but since exam allows to bring calculator, so didn\u0026rsquo;t work on that part much.\nInstead of teaching on each question, taught him the methodology:\n Write the general formula -\u0026gt; Formula shifpform to the given condition -\u0026gt; substitue in all the numbers -\u0026gt; calculate\n Like in the circle circumference questions, taught the student to write same formula for all the questions, and then look intot the given conditions and shift the formula\n  C = Pi * d Change d to 2r if the only given r Input all the number Calculate   He can apply the method to all the questions eventually, then when doing circle area questions, he knows how to apply same method with different fomula.\nFeedback Asked the student to practice, and plan to give two questions regarding circle cicumeference and area in the next session.\nDuring the session, I learnt something as well:\n Be more patient, especially with kid, they are shy and fragile, more sensitive to your experession and tone. Bonding is important. Understand how the others' mind work, and think what\u0026rsquo;s a better way to tech them to accept Encouragment is important so they not feel too frustrated. Learnt some Math terms in English since my elementary Math was taught in Chinese, some terms I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar or never heard of. Also reviewed some forgoten knowledge like what\u0026rsquo;s chord.  To-Do\u0026rsquo;s  Check-in weekly status to the organization Share the signed goal-setting document signed by the student with the parents Printout practice questions regarding circle for next session work on composite circle next week Review previous primary five questions since the review time left for the student is only one month at most after he finish his whole textbook.
