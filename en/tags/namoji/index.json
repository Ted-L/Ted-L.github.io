Current WiFi is IEEE802.11ac standard, it has dual band, 5GHz band and 2.4GHz band.\nß\nNormally wireless connection is more stable and faster, while maintianing stable and fast connection for wireless is a challenge.\nTesting scenario Home user\u0026rsquo;s Internet normally consist: Optical Network Router (ONR), it will translate optical signal to network as modem, and since the name \u0026lsquo;router\u0026rsquo;, it is also a DHCP server. This device may/may not serves as wireless Access Point (AP). If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have wireless function, we need another AP router to connect to it. In our setup, we just connect our mesh device to this ONR to serve as wireless AP router. Connect IPTV set-top box to our mesh node directly through LAN port. The overall topology will be the following:\n Test tools/software Some wifi testing tools will be used for this report, the details of how to use them won\u0026rsquo;t be in details, just some of the result will be presented.\n Hardware: Sniffer RTL8814 (ASUS USB-AC68), Ethernet cable, Phone, Laptop Software: Omnipeek, Wireshark, SpeedTest URL: http://www.speedtest.net/ APP: Net Analyzer, Wifi Analyzer, Speedtest, Singtel HeatMap  Common user reported issues    Cases Major Steps in debugging Root Cause Solution     Mesh node can’t get IP addresses. Use Wireshark to monitor packet in distributing IP Spanning tree is not enabled and loop will happen Enable spanning tree   Internet intermittence and video/gaming lagging Test wifi coverage and signal strength. monitor packet loss. Check hardware conditions like LAN port bandwidth and connectivity Test using different devices and different testing tools or website Weak coverage and broken LAN cable or 100mbs port only. WiFi mesh blocked if multiple Ethernet backhauled. Some video server or gaming server is slow by nature. Change AP location to expand coverage. Fix the hardware to prove. Unblock WiFi mesh if it’s the better path.   Can’t connect WiFi, showing “incorrect password” Tried in different location and monitor the devices’ whereabout status. There’s another AP with same SSID but different password nearby, customer forgot to off the old AP. Turn off the previous leftover AP.   Only particular iPhone can’t connect WiFi Replace our device with other device to test, also log sniffer data to find the failing stage. Blacklisted by the Optical Network Terminal. Remove the blacklist.   Philip 50pft6200 smart TV can’t connect our mesh Compare with other AP and sniffer data Due to 11k, if ft_enable=1, this device doesn’t support encryption mode of WPA2/WPA mix will. Change default encryption mode to be WPA2   iPhone shows “incorrect password” when try to connect and unable to connect 1 of the mesh Ensure environment and signal are ok to connect for the device, and compare the encryption mode in sniffer packet Askey device need to be reset before upgrade firmware, otherwise the encryption mode will be set different as shown on UI Factory reset on UI before upgrade firmware   Can’s use WPS to pair Sniffer packet, use WiFi analyser to locate the devices sending WPS probe. Another vendor’s AP WPS button was stuck and kept on sending WPS Turn off the interfering AP.   Keep roaming between APs, iPhone and Android will lose connection forever after around 3 times roaming Use sniffer to log data and found the roaming is caused by our disassociation Phone will decide not connect to the AP who disassoc it too often 3 minutes waiting time before triggering our roaming mechanism    ","description":"Share some comon wifi issues faced by real home users and share some wifi testing method and result.","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"HomeuserWifiTest","uri":"https://ted-l.github.io/en/posts/homeuserwifitest/"},{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s mesh? Mesh overview  IEEE published the 802.11 amendment for mesh networking, 802.11s, primary goal is targeted to provide more stable better performance for the whole network using more \u0026lsquo;connected nodes\u0026rsquo;. The entire wireless mesh could be treated as a single (giant) Ethernet switch.     Mesh advantages: simple, fast installation, more suitable for the application:  Where wires are not desired (e.g., hotels, airports) Where wires are impossible (e.g., historic buildings)    Mesh vs. Repeater  Auto connect: A mesh node can automatically scan nearby mesh nodes and join the mesh network without further configuration. More available paths: each nodes in the network can communicate with each other.    Path recovery: Mesh can resume network traffic if any node breaks down, repeater will have network breakdown if node in between breaks.   Terminology  Mesh Point (MP)  A station (STA) that implements the mesh facility. A mesh STA that operates in the mesh BSS (MBSS) may provide the distribution services for other mesh STAs.\n Mesh Access Point (MAP)  A mesh station that is collocated with one or more access point(s).\n Proxy Mesh Station (Portal, MPP)  A mesh STA that represents 802 entities outside the mesh basic service set (MBSS).\n Peering  A logical relationship from one mesh STA to another mesh STA that has been established with the mesh peering management (MPM) protocol\n Mesh Gate  A mesh station that has access to external STAs (STAs outside MBSS) called a Mesh Gate.

Practice on the fundamentals of Math. Practice on the past years' papers. Sync up progress, look for more methods can be useful.  Background  During the past few training sessions, student displayed good quality to follow instructions, but most of the times, can\u0026rsquo;t give correct feedback. Realised the student\u0026rsquo;s foundation is weak, he is not good at calculation, logic is weak. The reason could be lack of interest in the subject, and caused the weak result, and the weak result will produce less of confidence. PLSE exam syllabus was modified, many topics have been removed which may be a good news. Tutoring sessions were converted to fully online as of 22th July 2021 as Singapore returns to phase two for the restriction of COVID-19.  Procedure  Carried on sessions in a combination of in-person and online due to COVID-19 regulations. During the in-person session, worked on workshop books and textbooks. During the online session, Mendaki workshop book was used, and with the help of Google meeting. The top reasons to choose Google meeting are it is free, can use whiteboards JAM to collaborate with the student. Also asked the student\u0026rsquo;s parent to send the homework before our online session to force him to work and try the questions. Reviewed the homework and discuss. Went through school topics and exam papers. Since the online session is more difficult than in-person, student may be distracted easily and ignored to interact. So I tried some methods to get his attention, like asked the student read out all the questions. Asked the student to try to answer questions even he didn\u0026rsquo;t know the exact result.  Session All the training sessions lasted around 1.5 hours and 2 hours. They are hosted on Friday nights, or during the weekends' time if the Friday was busy.\nIf it was online, it will be using ZOOM or Google Meeting.\nFeedback The student is still not capable nor confident to pass the exam.\nTime is precious since time left for the final exam is merely less than two months.\nAfter study some of the past year paper and the syllabus, an estimation for the student to try all the questions is summarised like the following:\n   Paper Booklet Item Type Numer of\nquestions Numer of\nmarks per\nqustions Total\nmarks Duration     1 A Multiple-choice 10 1 10 1 h     Multiple-choice 5 2 10     B Short-answer 5 1 5      Short-answer 10 2 20    2  Short-answer 5 2 10 1 h 30 min     Structured/\nLong-anwer 12 3, 4 or 5 45    Total   47 - 100 2 h 30 min    Conclusion: From the above table, I will ask the student to try to score 1 mark in 1 minute for paper 1, and 1.6 minutes for paper 2. And for the correlation of number of questions and the marks, roughly 1 question in paper 1 and paper need to be finished around 2 minutes and 5 minutes respectively.\nTo-Do\u0026rsquo;s  Look for more past year papers and delete the obsolete topics. Ask the parents to take more actions on educating the kid: check homework, accompany during tutoring sessions, encourage the kid, etc. Try on the past year papers by myself before the session so I\u0026rsquo;m more aware of how to organise the tutoring session.

Realised the student\u0026rsquo;s calculation ability is weak, he is still counting fingers when encounter any calculation. Student is shy but willing to learn and listen to instructions which is good.  Procedure  Reviewed the circle formula with him but he had forgotten the formula The student also didn\u0026rsquo;t finish the homework. Review circle. Gave him the easy way to memorise the formula as C=2 pie R, and S=pie R2. And asked him to write down the same formula for all the related questions during test.

Taught him some tricks:\n During MCQ questions, assume 1 number and think if it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable for the choice if doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to solve,\ni.e. Mike is x years old, his mother\u0026rsquo;s age is triple Mikes', what is Mike\u0026rsquo;s mother\u0026rsquo;s age?\nChoice: 1) x+3; 2) x/3; 3) x-3; 4) 3x\nIf don\u0026rsquo;t know the answer, let\u0026rsquo;s assume Mike\u0026rsquo;s x =10, so for all the first 3 choice will be the age of 13, 3.333; 7; all don\u0026rsquo;t make sense, the fourth choice is 30, possible, so it\u0026rsquo;s the only choice.\n During the session, I learnt something as well:\n The parent is willing to put more effort on the student, they hired another tutor, but the other class is not 1-to-1 so didn\u0026rsquo;t go through everything the student done. The parent offers to hire me for more tutoring sessions, but unfortunately I don\u0026rsquo;t have too much extra time and it is not right to charge since I work on volunteer purpose. The student actively asked for homework, and this time I only gave him two questions so he has more time and more willingness to finish them rather than avoid them.

And finish this week\u0026rsquo;s learning goal. And plan next sessions.\nBackground Preparation: The work I have done is to go through the coach briefing and review the PLSE syllabus. Get an idea of how much time do I get to prepare the student to pass the exam and how to organise the training sessions including timing and venue.\nAbout the student: Primary six student, grade is AL8 which represent \u0026lt; 20 out of 100\nProcedure  Introduce oneself to both of the parents and the student Set up goal for the whole program\nIncrease the mark from AL8 to AL5, for \u0026lt;20 to 65~74, originally the student proposed of 45~64\nThe logic behind is to get 6 marks increment per month for the remaining 5 months\nTarget for the student is to get to his dream school which he already had in mind Start collecting the student\u0026rsquo;s study materials\nSchool textbook, school workbook as the main source, other supplementary material depends on the progress to be used as add-ons  Session Training session last duration of this time is two hours from 8pm - 10pm on this Friday 23 April 2021.\nTaught the student on his weakness of circles, during the session, realised he has also weakness in calculation, but since exam allows to bring calculator, so didn\u0026rsquo;t work on that part much.\nInstead of teaching on each question, taught him the methodology:\n Write the general formula -\u0026gt; Formula shifpform to the given condition -\u0026gt; substitute in all the numbers -\u0026gt; calculate\n Like in the circle circumference questions, taught the student to write same formula for all the questions, and then look into the given conditions and shift the formula\n  C = Pi * d Change d to 2r if the only given r Input all the number Calculate   He can apply the method to all the questions eventually, then when doing circle area questions, he knows how to apply same method with different formula.\nFeedback Asked the student to practice, and plan to give two questions regarding circle circumference and area in the next session.\nDuring the session, I learnt something as well:\n Be more patient, especially with kid, they are shy and fragile, more sensitive to your expression and tone. Bonding is important. Understand how the others' mind work, and think what\u0026rsquo;s a better way to tech them to accept Encouragement is important so they not feel too frustrated. Learnt some Math terms in English since my elementary Math was taught in Chinese, some terms I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar or never heard of. Also reviewed some forgotten knowledge like what\u0026rsquo;s chord.  To-Do\u0026rsquo;s  Check-in weekly status to the organization Share the signed goal-setting document signed by the student with the parents Printout practice questions regarding circle for next session work on composite circle next week Review previous primary five questions since the review time left for the student is only one month at most after he finish his whole textbook.

If you think you\u0026rsquo;re ready to buy a house, the first question is like to be \u0026ldquo;how much can I afford\u0026rdquo;, some calculation needed to be done for the fordability and appetite study so we\u0026rsquo;d know how to plan better.\n Background  This post is on study my own situation and have a rough idea what\u0026rsquo;s my affordability to better plan my next move. Focus will be on Singapore property market.\n Questions to be asked about buying Singapore property:\nWhat type of properties am I eligible to buy? There\u0026rsquo;re mainly 3 types of properties for residence in Singapore:\n HDB flats Executive Condominiums (ECs) Private properties  I have bought 1 HDB 4 years ago on the resale market, the regulation has limited the ability for everyone to purchase properties as the controlling method of property market. And 1 household can only has 1 HDB or EC maximum, thus only private is the choice for my current consideration unless sell the HDB. The detailed rules can be found in the following link: HDB gov website.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a thing called minimum occupation period (MOP), The MOP is calculated from the date you collect the keys to your flat. It excludes any period where you do not occupy the flat, such as when the whole flat is rented out or when there has been an infringement of the flat lease.\nThe MOP duration depends on the purchase mode, flat type, and date of flat application, for my case, the MOP is 5 years, and for other types, you can check on HDB Gov website. The date I can purchase another property is after October 2022, so the I still have minimum 1 year to plan the next purchase.\nStatistics What are the money source of the property for me? Depending on the liquidity, my money sources come from: cash, stock fund, insurance deposit, cpf ordinary account, bank loan.\nCash is direct source, stock fund can be withdrawn around 1 week time due to the conversion and bank transaction duration. Insurance deposit is a long-term deposit plan, for me, I\u0026rsquo;ve invested since 2015 but the plan only ends after September 2040, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t count now. CPF ordinary account is the source as well depending on the amount.\nWhat are the cost? The house price, the tax, other malicious cost.\nBesides house price, tax is more complicated, basically, the tax includes: Buyer\u0026rsquo;s Stamp Duty (BSD), since it is the second house, the Additional Buyer\u0026rsquo;s Stamp Duty (ABSD) will comply.\n   Purchase Price or Market\nValue of the Property BSD Rates for\nresidential     First $180,000 1%   Next $180,000 2%   Next $640,000 3%   Remaining Amount 4%       Type of buyer ABSD rates     Singapore Citizens buying 2nd residential property 17%   PRs buying 1st residential property 5%   PRs buying 2nd and subsequent residential property 25%   Singapore Citizens buying 3rd residential property 25%    What are the maximum loan I can get for HDB and Condominum respectively? If buying HDB instead of Condo, mortgage service ratio (MSR) of 30% applies, so higher salary is needed for the same amount of loan. The projected table is like the following:\n   Salary S$5,000 S$7,000 S$10,000 S$12,000 S$14,000 S$16,000 S$20,000     Maximum HDB loan amount 299,626 419,476 599,252 719,103 838,953 958,804 1,198,505   HDB Installment 1,199-1,270 1,678-1,778 2,397-2,540 2,876-3,048 3,356-3,556 3,835-4,064 4,794-5,080   Maximum Condo loan amount 612,411 857,375 1,224,822 1,469,786 1,714,751 1,969,715 2,449,644   Condo Installment 2,114-2,264 2,959-3,170 4,228-4,528 5,073-5,433 5,918-6,339 6,764-7,244 8,455-9,055    Scenarios  As a Singapore Citizen, I have the choice of keep my current public house which is called HDB and buy another property. While situation of the cost will be effected greatly if I do so. The following will have some calculation regarding the different cases and the projected property value I\u0026rsquo;ve used is SGD 1 million; 1.5 million; 2 million; 2.5 million respectively as reference.\n Option one: Keep current HDB Cost The government makes it much harder for resident to own more than one property to cool down the market. Higher tax will apply and the lower loan amount we will get.\nFrom the above table, BSD and ABSD can be as following regarding different property prices.\n   Purchase Price or Market\nValue of the Property BSD Rates for\nresidential S$1,000K S$1,500K S$1,800K S$2,000K S$2,500K     First $180,000 1% 1,800 1,800 1,800 1,800 1,800   Next $180,000 2% 3,600 3,600 3,600 3,600 3,600   Next $640,000 3% 19,200 19,200 19,200 19,200 19,200   Remaining Amount 4% 0 20,000 32,000 40,000 60,000   Total BSD 1%~4% 24,600 44,600 56,600 64,600 84,600       Type of buyer ABSD rates S$1000K S$1,500K S$1,800K S$2,000K S$2,500K     Singapore Citizens buying 2nd residential property tax 17% 170K 255K 306K 340K 425K       Property Value S$1,000K S$1,500K S$1,800K S$2,000K S$2,500K     Total Tax\nBSD+ABSD 194,600 299,600 362,600 404,600 509,600    To get as much bank loan as possible, I need to clear my existing mortgage first so my loan will be considered as first property by bank. There\u0026rsquo;s another 200K needs to be cleared.\n   Total Cost S$1,000K S$1,500K S$1,800K S$2,000K S$2,500K     Singapore Citizens buying 2nd residential property total tax 194,600 299,600 362,600 404,600 509,600   Existing loan to clear 200K 200K 200K 200K 200K   Total cost 1,394,600 1,999,600 2,362,600 2,604,600 3,209,600    Income Cash is king, more cash will definitely make the purchase smoother. Current stock fund can be valued at 20K SGD. Since it is the second house, CPF fund can only be used in the amount of excess of $90,500 in my OA+SA/RA, which currently no excess. I can\u0026rsquo;t use CPF as fund. So the downpayment will be solely on cash excluding the loan amount.\nThe main money sources fall into cash and loan, to consider loan, loan tenure is capped at 30 years for HDB properties, and 35 years for non-HDB properties until the age of 65. The best tenure I can get is before my 35 years old for private house. The loan to value (LTV) ratio changes significantly depending on how many loans. If I have 1 housing loan, the maximum 2nd LTV ratio will drop from 75% to 45%. The 30% difference for 1million house is already 300K which is higher than my left loan of current property, so the better choice would be paying up the existing loan to get more from the bank. That\u0026rsquo;s why the 200K is suggested to be paid in cash.\n   Property price S$1,000K S$1,500K S$1,800K S$2,000K S$2,500K     Maximum loan amount 750K 1,125K 1,350K 1,500K 1,875K   Projected Salary 5,614 8,421 10,105 11,228 14,035   Downpayment amount 250K 375K 450K 500K 625K   Total cash needed = Total cost-Loan amt 594,600 874,600 1,012,600 1,104,600 1,334,600    If I want to purchase property as the listed values, I need 2 things: 1st match salary to the projected salary; 2nd set aside the total cash as illustrated in the above table.\nOption two: Sell current HDB Cost If current HDB is sold, it will recover approximately 320K cash. And there will be no ABSD. The additional cost will be the following tables.\n   Total Cost S$1,000K S$1,500K S$1,800K S$2,000K S$2,500K     Singapore Citizens buying 1nd residential property total tax 24,600 44,600 56,600 64,600 84,600   Existing cash from loan to offset -410K -410K -410K -410K -410K   Total cost 614,600 1,134,600 1,446,600 1,654,600 2,174,600   Tax difference comparing option one 170K 255K 306K 340K 425K    Income    Property price S$1,000K S$1,500K S$1,800K S$2,000K S$2,500K     Maximum loan amount 750K 1,125K 1,350K 1,500K 1,875K   Projected Salary 5,614 8,421 10,105 11,228 14,035   Downpayment amount 250K 375K 450K 500K 625K   Total cash needed = Total cost-Loan amt -135,400 9,600 96,600 154,600 299,600    Comparison of the 2 options  Clearly the cash sacrifice is quite different at the moment, ranged from 590K to 940K. Although the differences, need to consider this is taken into consideration of paid up the first property loan and get to keep the extra house, which should be valued at 600K when sale and generate rental yields. Option1 will keep 2 properties while option2 only keeps 1 property, the tax differences range from 170K to 425K, by keeping the HDB, if rental yield per year will be around 42K, the break even point will be less than 10 years which is a good deal, but taking into consideration this HDB will permanently counted as 1 property, so if more plans for future residence purchase, even higher ABSD which is 25% applies. The question falls into whether 10 years' breakeven is worth it or any changes within 10 years? Summary is if one can take the burden of heavy downpayment, keeping both of the properties is the better option.
